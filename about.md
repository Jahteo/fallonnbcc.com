<h2> About the church </h2>
We believe in the Assembly of God's [Statement of Fundamental Truths](https://ag.org/beliefs/statement-of-fundamental-truths).
Maybe write more about our mission and why we do what we do. Maybe not.

<h2> When & Where </h2>
Simple details about where & when we meet.

<h2> What to expect </h2>
Here's a great spot to write about what a service is like for folks new to town, new to church, or perhaps just looking to change churches.
